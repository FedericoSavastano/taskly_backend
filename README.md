## Taskly - Backend Repository

### üíª Description:
Taskly is a fullstack project management application inspired by tools like Trello, designed to streamline team collaboration and task organization.

The platform provides user authentication and account creation, ensuring secure access to projects. Once logged in, users can:
- Create and manage projects
- Assign roles and tasks to team members
- Track task progress by updating their status
- Add notes and comments directly to tasks for better context and communication

From a technical perspective, the frontend was built with React and TypeScript, delivering a responsive and type-safe user experience. The backend was developed using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB (Mongoose) with TypeScript, enabling scalable data management and a robust API layer.
This project demonstrates not only technical proficiency in the MERN stack with TypeScript but also the ability to design and implement real-world features for collaborative productivity tools.
